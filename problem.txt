Problem Description:

Microsoft Rewards is a popular program where users can earn points and redeem them for various rewards.
However, the process of earning points can be tedious and time-consuming, requiring users to perform
multiple searches on their browsers. Additionally, managing multiple IDs to maximize point accumulation 
can be both cumbersome and potentially raise red flags with spam detection systems. Another challenge 
users face is the risk of their Microsoft accounts being locked due to unusual activity, necessitating
constant monitoring of the lock status.

To address these issues, I have created an automation program. This program streamlines the 
point-grinding process by automating searches, allowing users to earn points faster without the need 
for manual intervention. Furthermore, it simplifies the creation of multiple IDs, removing the hassle of 
repeatedly generating new accounts. However, it is important to exercise caution when using multiple IDs 
to avoid triggering spam detection systems.

The program also includes an automated lock status check, saving users from the time-consuming task of 
individually verifying the lock status of each ID. By utilizing this automation tool, users can optimize 
their Microsoft Rewards experience and efficiently accumulate points.

To get started with the program, please refer to the README.md and requirements.ipynb files for 
detailed instructions and requirements.
