# Description

I automated the entire Microsoft Rewards system.

*Note: Check **requirements.ipynb** for requirements, setup and working.*

## Setup the **main.py** file: -
* Install the requirements from the **requirements.ipynb** file.
* Clone the repository using this command:
` $ git clone git@github.com:heylightning/mr-script.git `
* Run the main.py file using the following command:
` $ python main.py `

## Features
* **idConfiguration.py** file is a script designed to facilitate the automation process of making Microsoft IDs from the *data.py* or any other file containing the IDs and their passwords. In my case, I have used data.py that I have mentioned in the *.gitignore* file. 
* **lockConfiguration.py** file is a script developed to automate the checking process of Microsoft IDs for lock status. It provides a convenient and efficient way to determine whether a given ID is currently locked or not. This can be especially valuable in scenarios where a large number of IDs need to be monitored for potential lockouts.
